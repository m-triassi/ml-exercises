    "In this lab you'll use *cross validation* to do *hyperparameter search*, a particular form of *model selection*.\n",
    "* **Cross validation** is a procedure for *estimating* the test-time performance of a given model. Cross validation does not need access to any test data. Instead, it works by holding out some of the training data and using if it were testing data. In this lab we will focus on *K*-fold cross validation, where the training data is divided into *K* equally-sized chunks and each chunk gets a turn \"pretending\" to be a test set. This will be explained.\n",
    "* **Model selection** procedures try to select a \"best\" model from among many alternatives. The best model is usually the one that we can *expect* to have the best test-time performance. Since cross validation lets us *estimate* the test-time performance, many model selection procedures rely on cross validation as a subroutine.\n",
    "* **Hyperparameter search** is a particular *model selection* procedure that focuses on selecting one model from a family of related models. Hyperparameter search can therefore be seen as a \"model tuning\" procedure. For example, we can define all *DecisionTreeClassifiers* with *max_depth* $\\in\\{1,\\ldots,1000\\}$ as being a \"family\" with 1000 possible members to choose from. Hyperparameter search would find a particular setting for *max_depth* that is estimated to have the best possible test-time performance (*not* necessarily the best training performance).  A good hyperparameter search procedure will find good hyperparameters (hyperparameters estimated to have good test-time performance) using very few \"attempts\", since each attempt requires performing cross validation and this can be computationally demanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to understand what cross validation is, how it is used as a subroutine within a hyperparameter search procedure. You will be asked to try two different hyperparameter search procedures: grid search and random search.\n",

    "After hyperparameter search is completed and the final hyperparameters are chosen, you can now do the final evaluation on the model performance using a **held-out test set** if one is available. You explicitly held out a test set ($\\mathbf{X}_\\text{test}, \\mathbf{y}_\\text{test}$) in Exercise 1.2, so use that data here.\n",

    "Using your *GridSearchCV* and *RandomSearchCV* objects from Exercises 2.2 and 2.3 respectively, print the training accuracy and test accuracy of the \"best estimator\" found by each.\n",
    "* Use the **best_estimator_** attribute to retrive a model that was trained on *all* the training data using the *best* hyperparameters (the hyperparameters with best average validation performance).\n",
    "* Use **sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score** or the **score** method on the best estimator to compute the accuracy on the training data and on the test data.\n",
